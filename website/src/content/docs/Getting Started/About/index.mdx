title: Why Beamer
description: Welcome to the beamer documentation

There was a time, sometime in late 2020, when Beamer was just a routing part of a particular application, serving it pretty well in production. It seemed reasonable to share it on pub.dev, but then a name needed to be coined. I believe it took at least a month to settle on a name. The idea was to have a simple and descriptive name, but this was not so easy as many of the most obvious choices are already taken: Router, Navigator, ...

At the time I was watching the Star Trek series and it just hit me! We're doing a pretty similar thing as teleportation - taking the user to an entirely new stack of pages each time they navigate, as if they are being teleported to that part of the application. A slightly better word than "teleporter" is "beamer" as it's also kind of similar to the "router" - what Beamer really is under the hood (Router widget).
