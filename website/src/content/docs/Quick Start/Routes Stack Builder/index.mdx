For most navigation scenarios, using the __RoutesStackBuilder__ is a great choice which yields the least amount of code. This is concidered the simpelst way of navigation using beamer.

<RoutesStackBuilderExample />

After setting up our App like this, we can start navigating with:

```dart
Beamer.of(context).beamToNamed('/home');
```

#### _RoutesStackBuilder_ will pick and sort routes based on their paths:

For example:

- Navigating to `/books/1` will match all 3 entries from routes and stack them on top of each other.
- Navigating to `/books` will match the first 2 entries from routes.

The corresponding pages are put into `Navigator.pages` and __BeamerDelegate__ (re)builds the Navigator, showing the selected stack of pages on the screen.

#### Why do we have a _StackBuilder_ and what is a _BeamStack_?

__BeamStack__ is an entity which, based on its state, decides what pages should go into `Navigator.pages`. 

`StackBuilder` chooses the appropriate __BeamStack__ that should further handle the incoming __RouteInformation__. This is most commonly achieved by examining `BeamStack.pathPatterns`.

__RoutesStackBuilder__ returns a special type of __BeamStack__ - __RoutesBeamStack__, that has opinionated implementation for most common navigation use-cases.

If __RoutesStackBuilder__ doesn't provide desired behavior or enough customization, one can extend __BeamStack__ to define and organize the behavior for any number of page stacks that can go into `Navigator.pages`.
