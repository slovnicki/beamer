Navigation is done by __beaming__.

One can think of it as teleporting (beaming) to another place in your app. Similar to `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed('/my-route')`, but Beamer is not limited to a single page, nor to a push per se. BeamLocations produce a stack of pages that get built when you beam there. Beaming can feel like using many of Navigator's push/pop methods at once.
