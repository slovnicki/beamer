When nested navigation (i.e. nested `Navigator`) is needed, one can just put `Beamer` anywhere in the Widget tree where this nested navigation will take place. There is no limit on how many `BottomNavigationBar` should not be affected by navigation transitions, i.e. all the navigation is happening above it, inside another `Beamer`.

Here are some examples for nested navigation:
- [Bottom Navigation](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/tree/master/examples/bottom_navigation)
- [Bottom Navigation: 2](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/tree/master/examples/bottom_navigation_2)
- [Bottom Navigation: Multiple Beamers](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/tree/master/examples/bottom_navigation_multiple_beamers)
- [Bottom Navigation: Nested Navigation Drawers](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/tree/master/examples/nested_navigation)
- [Bottom Navigation: Sibling Beamers](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/tree/master/examples/multiple_beamers)

<hr />

In the snippet below, we also use a `Key` on `Beamer` so that a `BottomNavigationBar` can manipulate just the navigation within that `Beamer`.
