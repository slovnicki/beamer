The most important construct in Beamer is a **BeamStack** which represents a state of a stack of one or more pages.

A BeamStack has 3 important rules:

-   Know which URIs it can handle: **pathPatterns**
-   Know how to build a stack of pages: **buildPages**
-   A **State** object that holds the relation of the first 2

BeamStack is a abstract class that needs to be extended to use. The purpose of having multiple Stack's is to architecturally separate unrelated _places_ in an application.

| Stack             | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **BooksStack**    | Everything related to books.    |
| **ArticleStack**  | Everything related to articles. |
| **CustomerStack** | Everything related to customer. |
| **SettingStack**  | Everything related to settings. |
| **AuthStack**     | Everything related to auth.     |
