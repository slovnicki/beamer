### Predefined State (Easy)
__BeamState__ is a pre-made state that can be used for custom classes that extend __BeamLocation__.

It keeps various URI attributes such as:

-   __pathParameters__
-   __queryParameters__
-   __pathPatternSegments__
    -  The segments of chosen path pattern, as each __Location__ supports many of those.

<hr/>

### Custom State (Harder)

Any class can be used as __BeamState__ for a __BeamLocation__ even ChangeNotifier.
The only requirement is that a your class Needs to implement __RouteInformationSerializable__

##### Example

<CustomBeamStateExample />
